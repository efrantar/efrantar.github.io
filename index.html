subtitle: Machine Learning PhD Candidate @ IST Austria

<p>
I am a third-year Computer Science PhD candidate at IST Austria, supervised by Dan Alistarh, working on practical neural network compression.
Currently, I am particularly interested in hardware-aware methods and in combining different forms of compression such as sparsity and quantization.

Previously, I completed my Computer Science bachelor's and master's at Vienna University of Technology for which I received the Austrian State Prize that is awarded to the top 0.3% of graduates in the country.
In my free time, I enjoy creating very fast Rubik's Cube solving robots, some of which have set new world-records and have gathered several million views on YouTube.
